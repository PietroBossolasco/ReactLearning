### React Installation
Before you can start building and running React projects, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

Here are the steps to install React:

1. Install Node.js
You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Download the CLI
There are two main CLI:
* expo CLI.
* react native CLI.  
  
  I personally reccomand the expo CLI, it's easier and it has some good template.  
  For download it:
```
npm i -g expo-cli
```

3. Create project:
```
expo init projectName
```
  or:
```
npm init projectName
```

4. Choose your template
There are some useful template and you have to choose one of that (blank is a white project).

5. Navigate to the project directory

```
cd my-app
```

6. Run the project
```
expo start
```
or:
```
npm start
```

And that's it! You should now have a fully functioning React project. You can start building and adding components to your app.
